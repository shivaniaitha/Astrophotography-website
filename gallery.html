            <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/876aa52c3dabf6d49bfa60f109bd9c84c5921fe9/hub/2016/02/01/5ebe33b2-28ec-40fa-b8df-a3f7c7d1a450/unmoonearth.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200" alt="Astrophotography 1">
            <p>An astronaut floats untethered in space. The sun smiles with a Halloween grin. A camera on the space station sees a single airplane below. These are all space-related images that border on the unreal, but no Photoshop or CGI was used to create them. Space really is that crazy.

            <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/40ccae894d66ff89c4800a296c85016f61b94457/hub/2016/02/01/b4ef16e8-cda9-4738-a34a-b415db4a5e68/uniss.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200" alt="Astrophotography 2">
            <p>A person took this image. Look closely. You can see the International Space Station with the Space Shuttle Endeavour attached on the left side.So if both the ISS and the shuttle are in the image, then who took the photo? The answer is European Space Agency astronaut Paolo Nespoli. He was on board a Soyuz TMA-20 that undocked from the station in 2011 to carry a crew of astronauts back to Earth. That gave Nespoli the freedom to snap this spectacular, almost unreal image. </p>

            <h2>Photograph 3</h2>
            <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/ac419e7eafc113363770b7d3e251b18b1d0f25d0/hub/2014/10/13/723a1ebf-eee2-46c6-a52f-8acc1c10b0d3/halloweensun1.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200" alt="Astrophotography 2">
            <p>It looks like a prankster got loose over at NASA, but this image of a freaky smiling face on the sun is really just a fortunate coincidence. It comes from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, which imaged the sun in early October 2014 and caught it looking like a carved Halloween pumpkin.

The SDO sees things a bit differently than the human eye. The image blends two sets of wavelengths to create the orange glow. The facial features are active regions of greater light and energy.</p>

            <h2>Photograph 4</h2>
            <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/d29f47d4ec8c4110be10e94c9619e5deb8369644/hub/2016/02/01/d155c673-9cbd-49eb-9814-16710fe0e056/unjetpack.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200" alt="Astrophotography 2">
            <p>This isn't a scene from the 2013 Sandra Bullock and George Clooney space thriller "Gravity." This is a photo of NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless roaming free in space after leaving the Space Shuttle Challenger. McCandless' adventure in 1984 was made possible by a nitrogen jetpack called the Manned Maneuvering Unit. He maxed out at 320 feet away from the Challenger and made it back safely. </p>

            <h2>Photograph 5</h2>
            <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/35b97b987f773ad9dc4629b49cbbb355fdf26444/hub/2015/08/18/32eaa7f2-eb9c-4cef-b5c6-d892946b26ed/aurora32.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200" alt="Astrophotography 2">
            <p>Auroras are a fascinating phenomenon involving swirling lights. When viewed from Earth, they light up the night sky and might make you think magical fairies really exist. This image from the crew of Expedition 32 on board the International Space Station in 2012 looks like the product of an artist's imagination, but it's real.

The piece of equipment in the center is a mechanical arm attached to the space station. These spectacular light shows are one of the perks of being an astronaut on the ISS. </p>
